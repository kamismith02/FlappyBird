# Overview

This project involves creating a Flappy Bird clone using Python and Pygame. The game aims to provide an engaging experience where players control a bird navigating through pipes by pressing the spacebar to make the bird jump. The goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the pipes or the ground. The game features realistic physics, including gravity, to make the movement of the bird feel natural. As the game progresses, the speed of the pipes increases, making it more challenging.

I wrote this software to deepen my understanding of game development, especially in terms of collision detection, user input handling, and real-time updates. This project allowed me to apply and further explore concepts like event handling, object-oriented programming, and game mechanics.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- **Python 3**: The programming language used for this project, chosen for its simplicity and wide usage in game development.
- **Pygame**: A library for Python that makes it easy to write video games by providing functionalities for graphics, sound, and user input.

# Useful Websites

Here are some helpful resources I found during the development of this game:
* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) - Official Pygame documentation for reference on library functions and examples.
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com) - A great resource for learning Python and exploring related topics like game development and graphics.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - A go-to resource for troubleshooting coding issues and finding solutions to common programming problems.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to add the following features and improvements:
* **High Score Tracking**: Implement a system to track the player's highest score across sessions.
* **Background Music**: Add background music and more sound effects to enhance the user experience.
* **Improved Graphics**: Replace the current simple graphics with custom art to make the game visually appealing.
* **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce different levels of difficulty by adjusting the speed of the pipes or the frequency at which they appear.
* **Leaderboard**: Allow players to input their name and save scores to a leaderboard that can be accessed later.
